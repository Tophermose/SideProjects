        <p>My name is Matthew C. Joseph. My interests include: coding, renegade photography, and playing ukulele. 
            At coding and photography I consider myself a hobbyist.
            I currently know and play around with Java, Ruby, and JavaScript.
            I don't plan to make a career out of either, but it is mainly a way to express my creative side and nourish that area of my life.</p>
            <p>I have worked in the nonprofit sector for almost 3 years. I started as a volunteer at my current organization, Fountain House, in the Welcome Center.
            I learned how to do a lot of clerical work, such as being a receptionist and doing data entry requiring HIPAA training.
            After it became clear that I was on a level beyond what the Welcome Center could offer, I was introduced to the Communications Manager in the External Affairs department and was promoted to a Digital Projects Intern.
            During this time I was introduced to a number of important people in External Affairs, including the Chief Development Office and the Coordinator of Educational Partnership Development, which would become very important relationships in my work.
            The following year, when the Communications Manager was planning to go on maternity leave, I was transferred to the Tech Support Team after the Coordinator of Educational Partnership Development requested that I work for her.
            I was also invited by the Chief Development Officer to share her office, which proved to be very fortuitous.
            After this semester started, I was brought in on the Salesforce project in External Affairs as well as in Colleague Training and was promoted to a Strategic System Administrator Intern, my current job at Fountain House.
            In the future I plan to work in the nonprofit sector, so I am on the perfect path for this goal.
            </p>
            <p>I'm finally in a place where I feel like: <q>me.</q>
            I am excited for the new semester and can't wait to see how it pans out!</p>
