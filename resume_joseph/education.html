        <p>In terms of education, my experience is a bit limited. I went to a specialized high school, The High School of American Studies at Lehman College, as a teenager.
            There isn't much to say about that, but in my senior year we were the 19th highest ranked school in the country in terms of student performance. 
            When I went to HSAS it was a very diverse school.
            It was a relatively unknown school when I was 14, so it was easy to get into at the time. 
            However, after our national ranking, upper-middle class parents caught wind of it and suddenly it was a lot of student's top choice.
            The student body is now very homogenized, and I wish we could get it back to the diverse school it once was.
            I graduated with an Advanced Regents Diploma and moved on to SUNY New Paltz.</p> 
            <p>For about 2 years I studied at SUNY New Paltz as a Psychology major.
            During that time, I mainly focused on my general education credits and French.
            I don't remember much of the French, but after 2 years I realized that I didn't want to do a Psychology degree and left school.
            After that I wanted to try working to see what that could do for me.
            I worked as a cashier, a landscaper, and a clerical volunteer at the nonprofit I work at now.
            It wasn't until a few years ago that I realized what I wanted to do, and now I'm working on doing that.</p>
            <p>When I started at Borough of Manhattan Community College, I was able to transfer almost all of my credits from SUNY New Paltz to BMCC.
            This meant, aside from a few common core classes, I was able to focus on my major. 
            I was originally in Computer Network Technology, but I switched to Computer Information Systems last semester.
            I enjoy Computer Information Systems much more than Computer Network Technology, so I am happy I made the switch.
            I am especially pleased with the switch because my current internship is exactly what Computer Information Systems students study for.</p>
