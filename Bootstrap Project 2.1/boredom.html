  <h1>A Break in the Boredom</h1>
  </header>
  <p> Paul looked out of the window at the dreary world passing him by. The clouds threatened rain but he didn't care enough to bring an umbrella. He didn't care enough to dress for the weather so on this cold day his coat was too thin and his shoes weren't made for the impending downpour. The train shifted and went underground and he suddenly saw black. He looked at the seats across from him, empty. He looked at the seat next to him, also empty. But it was different. He focused his brain and pictured his new friend sitting next to him. There wasn't a place for his thick tail to go so it just spilled onto the floor. His webbed paws were folded in his lap and he looked back at Paul with his whiskered face. Paul looked back out the window and <q>saw</q> the otter sitting next to him and suddenly he felt less alone. <br />
    <br />
    Paul imagined the otter moving his paw over his, wishing he could feel the soft touch of his fur against his cold hand, but that was a pipe dream, a hope for a change in the monotony that he knew would never come. As much as he hoped for a change in his life, Paul never got any. The train slowed to a stop and they both got up, walking to the door. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Where are we going today, Paulie?</q> Asked the otter, or at least Paul had the otter ask him. <br />
    <br />
    <q>You know where we're going, James. I have to see my social worker today.</q> Thought Paul back to the otter. <q>And don't call me Paulie, I'm not seven anymore.</q> <br />
    <br />
    Paul had James laugh and pat him on the shoulder as they walked. Paul imagined this was what camaraderie felt like, from a person who understood him. They boarded a subway. It was crowded and Paul lost track of James. He panicked before looking out of the window at the black tunnel outside the train and saw James smirking back at him in the reflection. Paul took a seat, not taking his eyes off James for fear of losing him. <br />
    <br />
    After each stop the train emptied bit by bit and James had room to stand, and then sit in an empty seat across from Paul. A man took out a guitar and started playing a tune for the other passengers and Paul had James drum along to the beat. In his mind James liked drumming, taking extra time to see what made the best noise when hit by imaginary drumsticks. <br />
    <br />
    Paul's stop came and he dropped a dollar into the guitar player's case before departing, James put away his drumsticks and followed. They left the subway station and walked in the brisk cold. It still hadn't rained. James wasn't dressed for the weather and shivered as they walked, so Paul imagined a coat for his friend and suddenly the otter wasn't cold anymore. <br />
    <br />
    As Paul walked he ruminated about what would happen when he saw his social worker. She always berated him for not taking care of himself. When he didn't dress for the weather she'd throw an old coat she bought at Good Will for him and tell him to bring it back when it got warm. He had a small collection of coats at home that belonged to her from this winter, they were the only thing that smelled like another person in his apartment. When he realized his anxiety was reaching a peak he decided to use James for the reason he created his friend and had the otter feel like he did, and suddenly James lost his cool demeanor. <br />
    <br />
    <q>She's going to yell at us, Paul. Why are we going?</q> Asked James, shaking and wringing his hands (a nervous habit they both have.) <br />
    <br />
    <q>She cares about us.</q> Responded Paul in his mind. <br />
    <br />
    <q>If she does she's the only one.</q> Muttered James. <br />
    <br />
    <q>People care, we just don't respond to their texts and ignore their calls. That's why we're alone.</q> Reasoned Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>They all live in their ivory towers, unaware of what it means to actually struggle.</q> Snapped James. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Everyone has their own burdens, James. Just because they don't understand ours means that we understand theirs.</q> Comforted Paul, putting his hand on James' imaginary shoulder. <br />
    <br />
    In his diligence to handle his anxiety Paul sacrificed awareness of his surroundings and almost walked into a tourist taking a photo. He quickly righted himself and apologized, but James burst out laughing. Paul frowned at his friend. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Good one, Paulie. Way to make them think you're nuts.</q> Giggled James. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I'd rather they think I'm nuts for having an imaginary conversation than screaming at them over nothing.</q> Thought Paul to James. <br />
    <br />
    They walked the rest of the way in silence, arriving at their social workers office a few minutes later. They walked in and Paul checked with the receptionist while James took a seat and flipped through an imaginary magazine about fish. Paul took a seat next to him and checked his phone. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I was wondering how long it would take you to pull out your phone.</q> Snarked James. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Oh shut up and read your magazine.</q> Muttered Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>What's James doing?</q> Said a voice. <br />
    <br />
    Paul and James looked up, their social worker Dina was walking towards them. Paul blushed, having been caught talking to himself again. He shuffled his feet while James stood up. <br />
    <br />
    <q>He was giving me shit for pulling out my phone.</q> Said Paul, meekly. <br />
    <br />
    <q>You were using your phone as a distraction while waiting for me, don't be so hard on yourself.</q> Replied Dina. <q>Why don't you two come to my office?</q> <br />
    <br />
    <q>Yeah, sure.</q> Mumbled Paul. <br />
    <br />
    The three of them walked down the hall and into an office. Like always Dina had provided seating for both him and James. She sat across the room from them, smiling at Paul for a second, then giving him a frown. She tilted her head at little to the side and asked the first question she always asked. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Did you hang up your coat in the waiting room?</q> Asked Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>No...</q> Blushed Paul. <br />
    <br />
    Dina walked to her closet and pulled out a men's coat. She tossed it to Paul nonchalantly and retook her seat. James stifled laughter. He loved when Paul gets called on his negligence to himself. <br />
    <br />
    <q>You know the drill, Paul. Return it and the others when it warms up.</q> sighed Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Yes, ma'am.</q> Blushed Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>What's James doing right now?</q> Asked Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Trying not to laugh at me.</q> Frowned Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Do you know why?</q> Asked Dina?<br />
    <br />
    <q>Because he's a jerk?</q> Suggested Paul. James stopped laughing. <br />
    <br />
    <q>No, because he's the only person trying to make sure you take care of yourself. You know you hate being reprimanded and you hate being laughed at so you make him use negative reinforcement to get you to treat yourself better. Is he wearing a coat?</q> Queried Dina.<br />
    <br />
    <q>Yeah, he was cold so I gave him one.</q> Responded Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Did you eat this morning?</q> Asked Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I wasn't hungry.</q> Lied Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Did James eat this morning?</q> Questioned Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>He had some toast before we left.</q> Replied Paul. <br />
    <br />
    Dina sighed. She went into her desk and pulled out a power bar, tossing it to Paul. Paul looked at it for a minute before looking up and seeing both James and Dina looking at him expectantly, so he quickly opened it and started eating. Dina sat back down, giving him some time to eat before breaking the silence. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Do you know why I encourage you to have James around?</q> Asked Dina.<br />
    <br />
    <q>So I'm not alone all the time?</q> Wondered Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>No, because he encourages you to take better care of yourself.</q> Explained Dina. <q>Did he tell you to eat anything this morning?</q><br />
    <br />
    <q>Yeah, he might have said something a few times…</q> Blushed Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>And to check the weather before leaving?</q> Continued Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I thought he wanted to go fishing later…</q> Mumbled Paul, embarrassed. <br />
    <br />
    <q>You know that's not true. James is you trying to get you to take better care of yourself. Who told you to come see me today?</q> Queried Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>James did.</q> Sighed Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Exactly. You should listen to James more. It's the first step to getting your life back on track.</q> Smiled Dina. <br />
    <br />
    James had remained silent the entire time. He would shoot Paul caring looks occasionally, but he mostly listened. Their meeting with Dina went on as normal after that, discussing Paul's funds and duties he has for the day. However, towards the end of the meeting James stood up, staring at the door looking alarmed. His fur was standing on end. Paul looked at his friend, distressed. <br />
    <br />
    <q>What's wrong, Paul?</q> Asked Dina. <br />
    <br />
    <q>James is acting weird. I think he thinks we're in danger.</q> Responded Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I don't like this...</q> Muttered James. <br />
    <br />
    <q>What do you mean... why do you think we're in danger... Paul?</q> Questioned Dina, sitting up in her seat. <br />
    <br />
    As soon as she asked that question things got out of control. A rather large man burst in looking ravenous. He looked and Dina who quickly got out of her chair and walked towards the man with familiarity, but he slammed her with his fist and she went down. Next, he quickly bypassed James and went straight for Paul, closing his hands around Paul's neck. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I'll teach you for trying to steal my worker!</q> Bellowed the man.<br />
    <br />
    Paul couldn't breath. His mind was screaming, wanting action but going blank. He could only grab fruitlessly at the man's hands as they closed around his trachea. In his distress a single name popped into his head, and he squawked what might have been his final words. <br />
    <br />
    <q>J-james! Help me!</q> Cried Paul. <br />
    <br />
    Darkness was closing in, he was slowly losing consciousness. He saw James do something he had never done before. Without his urging or even thought James acted. He picked up a chair, actually making it move, and slammed it over the robust man's head. He went down to the floor unconscious. Paul crumpled to the floor too, his hands around his throat. James rushed to his side and put his hand on Paul's cheek, and for the first time he felt the otter's fur on his skin. Paul could only look at his friend, bewildered as he got used to breathing again. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I... I can feel your hand against my skin.</q> Choked out Paul. <br />
    <br />
    <q>I don't know what's happening either, Paul.</q> Responded James, without Paul's urging or willing. <br />
    <br />
    <q>Holy fuck... you're real...</q> Said Paul, brushing his hand against James' fuzzy ear.<br />
    <br />
    <q>I'm just as surprised as you are... I'll check on Dina, you call the police.</q> Responded James. <br />
    <br />
    Paul pulled out his phone and looked at his friend, like he as seeing him for the first time. James rolled over Dina and she sat up, but she couldn't see the otter. She crawled through him to Paul and took his phone to handle the 911 call. No one had any clue what the hell was happening, but it sure did break the monotony. <br />
