  <h1>That '70s Show Analysis</h1>
  </header>
  <p> <i>That '70s Show</i> is a TV show that is a perfect example of how class, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity impact people in the United States. The setting is Point Place, Wisconsin, from the years 1976-1980. Among the people of Point Place, the Formans and the Pinciottis are prime examples of the class divisions involved in social stratification. Donna Pinciotti and Kitty Forman are archetypes of women that show the difference of gender roles of the new generations. Every member of the cast, even those who play onetime roles, depicts and addresses different forms of sexuality. Finally, Point Place is a very white town. Fes is the only nonwhite regular cast member on the show; the fact that he is nonwhite in a very white community influences his life a lot. One big difference between the people in Point Place is their class.<br />
  <br />
  The Formans and the Pinciottis show the differences between two different classes. At the start of the series the Formans, with both parents working to make ends meet, are a lower middle class family. Kitty Forman is a nurse, and her husband Red Forman works part time at an auto parts factory. Neither has attended college, and Red, being a drafted veteran, may not have finished high school. They own their house and do want their son to attend college; their daughter is attending college at the beginning of the series. The Pinciottis are upper middle class. Bob Pinciotti may not have attended college, but he owns his own business, and makes enough money for his wife not to have to work to make ends meet. His daughter, Donna, would be able to attend a private college without tuition being a concern. Another thing that varies amongst the people of point place is age, which impacts both gender and sexuality in the show.<br />
  <br />
  The setting of <i>That '70s Show</i> is a time when feminism is on the rise. The Equal Rights Amendment was passed in 1972, and women are becoming more independent of the men in their lives. Whether or not women embrace these new opportunities is contingent on age. Kitty Forman does believe women should be treated equally, but she does not embrace the feminist movement. She is content with being a traditional mother. She cooks, cleans, and acts like a mother to her son's friends as well as her son; meaning she is the person they go to when they need comforting or advice on certain matters. While she fulfills the expressive roles, she also fulfills the instrumental roles. She works as a nurse for parts of the series; sometimes it is the only income the Formans have. When her place of work is shown in one episode, a male doctor constantly puts her down and reminds her of her position at the hospital. The joke in this is that the doctor is incompetent and Kitty is the one who keeps things together. To contrast with this Donna Pinciotti is a strong-minded woman who embraces feminist ideals. She is the one who <q>wears the pants</q> in her relationship with Eric Forman and in their relationship establishes that, if they got married, she would have a career even if they had children. Even when she becomes a radio personality that goes by the name Hot Donna she still does not give up her ideals. Being attractive may be part of her success, but she still keeps her feminist ideals. She once refused to wear a bikini at a promotional event because it was degrading to women. One would think that the age differences between the characters would also impact their sexuality, but it does not.<br />
  <br />
  The time setting of the show impacts the sexuality of the characters on the show. Even though the free love decade of the 1960s has ended, both the adolescents and adults of the 1970s were influenced by its ideals. Each of the teenage characters is at a point in their lives where they are becoming sexually active, fulfilling their desires. The Red and Kitty Forman are sexually active and desire each other after twenty-five years of marriage. The parents display bashfulness while talking about sex while the adolescents talk about it frequently. While every main character is heterosexual, both the adolescents and the adults do encounter homosexuality. When the adolescents first encounter homosexuality, they are <q>cool with it,</q> but revel in the fact that they are <q>cool with it.</q> Eric Forman is even kissed by a gay classmate. Eric, while visibly shaken, does not condemn the boy, and does not treat him differently after finding out that he is gay.  When Kitty and Red Forman have new gay neighbors Kitty worries how Red will react to them. Red does not care that they are gay, but he kicks them out of his house after finding out what football team they root for. This open-mindedness translates differently when it comes to minorities. <br />
  <br />
  <i>That '70s Show</i> has very few nonwhite characters. Fes, a foreign exchange student, is the only regular nonwhite character. It is a running joke that no one knows what country he is from; though it does not matter since all people see him as is nonwhite. He does encounter prejudice; he is targeted by bullies because of his race and is kicked out of a girlfriend's home for being nonwhite. Red Forman rarely calls him by his name and instead calls him the names of various nonwhite characters from the media. People often connect any peculiar behavior he has to the fact that he is foreign. Fes' ethnicity is questionable. By the end of the series he holds no ties to his homeland, he even once forgot where he is from. He knew his language but forgot it. He is also used as a point of reference; people link characteristics of several different cultures to him, they look down on every one. Fes is not even his real name, his real name is never revealed, just claimed to be too hard to pronounce. The name Fes is actually and acronym for Foreign Exchange Student.<br />
  <br />
  The '70s, like any decade, involved change in all aspects of social stratification, and <i>That '70s Show</i> depicts them. The Formans and Piciottis show class differences, Donna and Kitty represent gender influenced by different generations, and Fes' experience shows how difficult it is to be nonwhite in Point Place. <i>That '70s Show</i> displays social stratification in class, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity and how they impact people's lives.<br />
