  <h1>The Two G.W.s</h1>
  </header>
  <p>George Willard and Grant Wiggin, from <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> and <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i> respectively, are two characters at different stages in their lives.  George Willard is just out of high school, and Grant Wiggin is a college graduate. They do share something in common, they both want to leave their home. Grant did once before, he went to California, but he came back. And, at the end of <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i>, Grant decides to stay. George, at the end of <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>, chooses to leave Winesburg. It is unclear whether or not he will return. If his life is anything like Grant's, he will return, but he probably will not like what he will return to. To determine this Grant and George's spirituality must be examined; their relationships with their family, friends, and partners must be analyzed, their progression into manhood, and the final scene in each novel. First, their spirituality must be analyzed. <br />
  <br />
  To analyze Grant and George's spirituality, it is important to analyze the presence of religion in each book. However, instead of analyzing the spirituality of two non-religious people, it is more useful to analyze the presence of religion in their environment. In Winesburg, there is a reverend, Reverend Curtis Hartman. He was a grotesque (as Rosemary. M. Laughlin states in <i>Godliness and the American Dream in Winesburg, Ohio</i>: <q>Those who are agonizingly incomplete or unfulfilled, those who have had to suppress their overwhelming desires and needs to love, and, according to the Writer who collects the stories, those who mistook a myth for a falsehood around which to center their lives.</q>)  His life was incomplete, and to him his completion requires Kate Swift. On page 155 he claims: <q>she is an instrument of God, bearing the message of the truth.</q> And that is it; he is the holy man of Winesburg, peeping at a woman. It cannot be said that he did not have an influence, Reverend Curtis Hartman did preach at the largest church in Winesburg, but it is not said if George goes to church or not. He did, however, interact with George Willard. In <q>Strength of God</q> the reverend bursts into George's place of work claiming that he had found God in the naked form of Kate Swift. This may not give George a reason to leave, but it certainly does not make him want to stay. <br />
  <br />
  Grant's spirituality is specified. He is not an atheist, but he has no reason to believe in god. However, despite this, he is surrounded by religion. Everybody close to him has found religion; mainly Catholicism. Even the love of his life, Vivian, is a Catholic. Keith Byerman argues in <i>Bearing Witness: The Recent Fiction of Ernest Gaines</i> that Grant refuses to believe, but understands there are consequences for not believing. Grant's lack of religion is a subject of controversy for his small town; he is passive aggressively and aggressively criticized for it. While Grant is visiting Jefferson, the local reverend, Reverend Ambrose, criticizes Grant for not instilling a belief in God. On page 251 Grant gives a reason that he cannot believe, he says: <q>Don't tell me that God can bless this country and that men are judged by their peers. Who among his peers judged him… No, his peers did not judge him–and I will not believe.</q> Grant will not believe in a God that allows the inequality between Blacks and Whites to exist. This gives him a reason to want to leave Unlike George, Grant's religion strongly effects his family.<br />
  <br />
  George's family consists of a father and a mother. They live in a hotel called the New Willard House. The short story <q>Mother</q> tells the tale of George's mother Elizabeth Willard and her relationship with her son and husband. Elizabeth is an unwell woman who has desires to murder her husband to protect their son from him, she wishes for her son to be successful. His father is a man who, while putting on a happy face for customers, is deeply dissatisfied with his life, which is the result of being the democrat leader in a largely republican area. He needs a win. <i>Winesburg, Ohio: An Exploration</i> by Ray Lewis White examines the relationship between the three. He claims that there is a mutually unacknowledged controversy between Elizabeth and her husband, Tom. Both parents want their son to fulfill their own unfulfilled ambitions. For his mother, it is to escape Winesburg and go to the city. For his father, it is to buckle down and start being the successful man his father can be proud of and show off to other people. His father's pressure to succeed makes him want to follow his mother's unexpressed wishes. His mother also dies during the novel, giving him more motivation to leave. Grant's familial situation is different from George's; the most obvious difference is that he lives with his aunt.<br />
  <br />
  Grant's relationship with his aunt is based on guilt, lies and reliance, at least from Grant's perspective. Reverend Ambrose explains to Grant how his aunt lies. When she pretends everything is okay when it is not, she lies. When she acts like she is fine when she is not, she lies. She uses guilt to get Grant to do things. He does not want to go to Henri Pichot to help Miss Emma negotiate to get visitation with Jefferson, but he has no choice. He does not want to see Jefferson at first, but again, he has no choice. From Grant's perspective his aunt, and the entire community, relies on him; they need him. This pressure makes Grant want to leave. The important distinction between George and Grant when it comes to familial obligations is the obligations themselves. George is expected to be successful, and Grant is expected to help people. Aside from familial relationships, there is the relationship with the community.<br />
  <br />
  George is the only reporter in the town of Winesburg. That may seem like a lot and a little at the same time. While Winesburg is a small town, his position leads people to want to talk with him. It leads Reverend Curtis Hartman, Wing Biddelbaum, Doctor Parcival, Joe Welling, Wash Williams, Elmer Crowley, Tom Foster, and Belle Carpenter to speak with him. Wing Biddelbaum is so alone that he had hardly said a word to anyone before George came around, and Belle Carpenter walked with him because it's <q>a kind of relief to her feelings.</q> He also acts as a door to Winesburg, When the reverend enters the newspaper office declaring that Kate Swift's naked body is God incarnate, he is doing it so Winesburg can know of his discovery. When Elmer Crowley wishes to speak to George, he wants his story to be told, so people will not find him <q>queer.</q> The stories he gets from people only fuels his desire to leave Winesburg to pursue a career in the big city. The difference between George and Grant is that George likes this attention; it gives him a story to write.<br />
  <br />
  Grant, on the other hand, is the only man educated enough to be the teacher for his small town. He is relied upon greatly by the entire community to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic. His students are the children of workers on the plantation, so they go to school for fewer months than the city children. They are also given fewer supplies than the white schools. Despite all of the people counting on him, Grant hates his job. But while his obligations at home are for those of other people, the racial obligations in Bayonne are still present. In Bayonne, while in the presence of white people, he is expected to act subservient and less intelligent than he really is. He also has the obligation to go see Jefferson, to try and convince people that Jefferson really is a man, and not a hog, as Jefferson's attorney argued during his trial. Jefferson's plight eventually convinces Grant that he needs to stay. George and Grant find solace and maturity in their partners. <br />
  <br />
  George does not have one set partner. He had sex with Louise Trunnion in <q>Nobody Knows</q> and struggles with the notions that Kate Swift and Belle Carpenter are attracted to him. This is a sign of his youth. Eventually he stops looking for a woman to sleep with, and begins looking for a woman who can comfort him after the death of his mother. He thinks of Helen White. It is mentioned in <q>Sophistication</q> that they both want each other to see how they have grown, how they have changed. Helen is established as the girl that George will end up with. One of their moments is described as ending with a feeling of <q>they had both god from their silent evening together the thing needed.</q> In the final scene George pictures Helen putting a stamp on an envelope, possibly a letter to him. Helen becomes a reason for George to stay. Grant had a reason to stay as well, her name is Vivian. <br />
  <br />
  Vivian is the love of Grant's life. She is the only reason that Grant has not left yet. Like Grant, she is a schoolteacher, but in Bayonne. Vivian and Grant can never leave home. Vivian is separated and has two children. The father will not give Vivian a divorce unless he gets to see his children every weekend. He knows that Vivian and Grant are together, and he does not want them to leave. Their situation is complicated because Vivian is pregnant with Grant's child. Had Grand had met Vivian before he left for the first time, he may have stayed. Or, he may have been like George; he may have still left. This is what brings up the question of whether or not George will return. It is unclear if Helen White, who never got a chance to tell George how she felt about him, will be enough to draw him back to Winesbug. <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> is the tale of George's graduation into manhood. <br />
  <br />
  It is difficult to determine how one achieves manhood. Some people may argue that it is the loss of one's virginity that turns a boy into a man. In that case George is a man, he had sex with Louise Trunnion. If it is dealing with death, he does; his mother dies. If it is surviving a fight, he does, when Elmer Crowley beats him up. If it is desiring more out of a relationship than sex, he does, when he is with Helen White he wants acceptance and sympathy, It is also argued that <q>There is a time in the life of every boy when he for the first time takes the backward view of life. Perhaps that is the moment when he crosses the line into manhood.</q> However, Sherwood Anderson, in <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> only uses these as stepping-stones to the final scene when he finally achieves manhood. By leaving to be on his own, he achieves manhood. <br />
  <br />
  Grant is not a man by Sherwood Anderson's standards. He has the stepping-stones. He has had sex. He has, by the end of the novel, dealt with death. He survives a fight. However, it is unclear to Vivian whether or not he wants more than sex out of their relationship and Grant does not give much of an argument against it. Grant never really takes on the stance of having a backward view of life; he only lives in the present. If leaving is the final stepping-stone to manhood, Grant had left. But, Grant returned. And now that he wants to leave again, he cannot do it. By these standards, George is more of a man than Grant is. However, in <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i> there is another boy who needs to achieve manhood, Jefferson. Jefferson had been called a hog by his defense attorney, and needed to prove that he was a man when he was walking to the electric chair. Grant tells Jefferson he needs to be the hero that Grant could never be. In his speech on page 191, Grant can never be the hero because he hates it there and wants to leave. Jefferson can be the hero by being someone his community can be proud of, someone who walked to the chair with his head held up high. Ernest Gaines himself said: <q>He in one way makes the condemned boy, who is like an animal, a man, and the condemned one makes him a man so he can go back to develop something.</q> Meaning, it is through Jefferson that Grant achieves manhood. Even it is not by Sherwood Anderson's standards. After all, to Ernest Gaines manhood does not come from independence, it comes from accepting your place in the world. The final scenes have the utmost importance.<br />
  <br />
  The final scene in <i>Winesburg,Ohio</i> is George leaving Winesburg to go to the big city. It is time for him to take charge of his own life and to seek a career elsewhere. He seeks to become a journalist. It is unclear whether or not he will succeed. It has been made clear that the only thing holding him back to Winesburg is Helen White, and in the final short story <q>Departure,</q> she never gets to tell him how she feels. It is unclear if she even felt any feelings that would make Greorge want to stay. At the end of the novel George pictures Helen putting a stamp on an envelope, possibly a letter to send to him wherever he ends up. He has no other motivation to come back, even for his father. The question is, why did Grant return?<br />
  <br />
	It is never made clear why Grant returned to his small town. If he had met Vivian before he left then he had a very good reason to return. If not, then his intentions are questionable. It is possible that no one is entirely able to stay away from home. Perhaps Grant felt incomplete being away. Or maybe he felt guilty for leaving his aunt, who has a habit of making him feel guilty. This is all speculation, but it does provide reasons for why George may stay. In the final scene in <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i> Grant is content to stay and do his duty has teacher to the children of his hometown. It is obvious that he will not leave. <br />
  <br />
  In <i>A Lesson Before Dying</i> and <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> both Grant Wiggin and George Willard have dreams of leaving their small towns to go somewhere else. By examining their spirituality, their relationships with their families, communities, and partners, their progression into manhood, and the final scene it is only possible to infer what will happen. Grant left, returned, wanted to leave again, but ultimately stayed. His return was influenced by the people he had at home. George may have had friends in the community, but in the novel he only gets close to one person especially, Helen White. He plans to keep in contact with her (if he pictures her sending letters he must have sent her an address.) So, she may be motivation to return to Winesburg. If that is the case then Grant may just be the next stage in George's life. If Elmer Crowley does come back it does seem like he would end up in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />
