    <p>Magnetic woman<br />
    Pragmatic woman<br />
    Taking our electrons<br />
    Even if we were made of bronze<br />
    <br />
    Ecstatic woman<br />
    Enigmatic woman<br />
    The light that attracts fireflies<br />
    The wonders that you surmise<br />
    <br />
    A woman, the woman<br />
    Only human but somehow transcends<br />
    No need for bitter ends<br />
    <br />
    Important but not impatient<br />
    Caring but not complacent<br />
    A cornflower in a graying field<br />
    How are you even real?<br />
