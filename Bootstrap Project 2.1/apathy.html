  <h1>What You May Not Care To Know About Poltical Apathy</h1>
  </header>
  <p> The human mind easily the greatest threat to mankind. It is important to note that threats do not have to be tangible to be dangerous. The human mind prevents progress; certain concepts, whether conscious or unconscious, are responsible for many of the issues that the country faces today. Concepts like the Nirvana Fallacy, Confirmation Bias, the Bystander Effect, and the Historians' Fallacy will lock the human mind into one perspective, preventing progress and allowing us to make the same mistakes over and over again. Apathy is fueled by these concepts. Apathy alone is a dangerous thing; individual people can be apathetic about important things and they suffer for it. However, when apathy is widespread, it grows into an entity and begins effecting a large number of people, it is like a virus. When apathy begins effecting things on a large scale, it is time to do something about it. Politics are a great example of a <q>large scale</q> thing. Politics establish the perfect scenario for people to observe how the human mind can get stuck on one perspective, and how apathy proceeds to make things worse. When people hear the word <q>politics,</q> they think of the President, Congress, and other political entities; and they proceed to think about how they are responsible for a lot of the problems that the country faces today. They usually forget one important factor in politics, the voters. One important issue that people do not think about is how the voters can have just as much influence as our elected officials. And there lies a very important issue that affects this country in a big way, the voters. To be more specific, the politically apathetic voters, the people who do not care about voting or politics. <br />
  <br />
  Political apathy can be defined as not caring about politics. However, combating this apathy is not as easy as convincing an apathetic person that reading the newspaper or watching the local news is important. It is not a matter of just becoming informed, it is a matter of being <i>fully</i> informed. It is simple to read the newspaper or watch the local news and feel like you know what is going on in the world. But, it is also easy to be misinformed by news sources. That is why it is important to look beyond the normal means of information, and see what other sources have to say. Being more informed on a situation can greatly effect your decisions, including political ones like voting. Sadly, the remedy to this lack of enthusiasm for political knowledge is not that easy.<br />
  <br />
  People do not like to admit when they are wrong, and it is likely that they will not care about information that would contradict their beliefs. This can make seeing things from a new perspective difficult. Even when it is easy, with informational resources like the Internet being readily accessible, the human mind prevents man from looking for any information that would disprove his views. It is called Confirmation Bias, which is described by Richard A. Griggs in his book <i>Psychology: A Concise Introduction</i> as: <q>the tendency to seek evidence that confirms one's beliefs</q> (Griggs 222). Confirmation Bias prevents people from finding out about other people's political views, and it allows a voter to believe they are informed when they are not. While it disrupts a person's ability to seek information, Confirmation Bias is not the only concept that leads to political apathy. While there are some people who do not care enough to find different perspectives of a different topic, others simply just do nothing at all. Richard A. Grigg's <i>Psychology: A Concise Introduction</i> defines the Bystander Effect as: <q>the probability of a person helping in an emergency is greater when there are no other bystanders than when there are other bystanders</q> (Griggs 341). This means that the more people there are around to witness an accident, the less the chance someone will do something to help. What if there were 218 million witnesses? In the United States as of 2010, there were 218, 054,301 people eligible to vote. In the 2010 election for senators, only 41.6% of the voting age population voted. This means that roughly 127,343,721 people who were eligible to vote did not. That means a minority of the voting population was making decisions for the entire population. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that a number of those people could not vote due to work or some other important activity, but it is likely that the reason these activities were prioritized over voting is because the people thought that their vote was inconsequential. Those people trusted other people to vote for them. That is probably why in August of 2011 National Public Radio writer Bill Chappell noted that Congress had a 13% approval rating. (NPR). Unfortunately, the human mind will not be satisfied with the knowledge that by not voting, the person is not responsible for putting the people into office. People believing that their vote is inconsequential fall victim to a closely related flaw in human thinking.<br />
  <br />
  The Nirvana Fallacy is a term coined by economist Harold Demsetz in an article in the 1969 <i>Journal of Law and Economics</i>. The Nirvana Fallacy is the logical error in human thinking that makes people believe that their efforts will not actually change anything because that change is not the idealized change that they would like to make happen (Demsetz 1). People who fall victim to the Nirvana Fallacy believe that giving money to charity is pointless because it will not solve the poverty problem. It leads people to believe that doing something as easy as voting will not change the problems that the country is facing today because that change is not instant. It also leads people to believe that their vote does not matter because they cannot see the link between their vote and a change in society. This error in human thinking makes people believe that they cannot solve anything, and they respond to situations by doing nothing. This belief is toxic to the human race; it prevents people from doing great things. People will not attempt to change things, and change in this sense carries over to things beyond politics. People are hesitant to donate money or time to charities because they do not believe their contributions will do anything. If it stretches beyond their grasp, they will not try to reach for it. If it is out of sight, it is out of mind. This flaw in human thinking that results in people doing nothing for a cause is similar to another faulty concept in the human mind, the Historians' Fallacy.<br />
  <br />
  The Historians' Fallacy, as described by David Hackett Fischer's <i>Historians' Fallacies</i>, is the habit to treat the outcomes as events as obvious (Fischer xvii). It is a theory that attempts to explain why we keep finding ourselves in wars and financial peril. In this case, the people who did not vote did so because they knew that the elected senators would end up being unsatisfactory. The issue, besides the delusion of superiority, is that this idea does not allow the person to learn from the other person's mistakes. Because of this, their mistakes will be repeated. Following the example of bystanders and approval ratings, in June 2008, NPRâ€™s <i>Day to Day</i> program noted that Congress' approval ratings were 19%, and in November 2008, Senate elections were held (NPR). Two years later, even after a new election was held in 2010, the approval ratings were even lower. The voters did not learn from their mistakes. <br />
  <br />
  However, people not voting may actually be a good thing. Many people, like myself, do not know much about politics. The question should not be <q>why vote?</q> it should be <q>should I vote?</q> It might be a good idea for people who do not know who they are voting for or why they are voting for them, people who don't know what each candidate plans to do when in office, and people who vote across party lines without researching who they are voting for to not vote. The Confirmation Bias might prevent people from looking for information that could contradict their own and the Historians' Fallacy might prevent people who voted blindly and were unsatisfied with their decisions from doing so again in the next election. Apathy and ignorance are enemies to our citizens. <br />
  <br />
  The unfortunate truth is that Confirmation Bias, the Nirvana Fallacy, the Bystander Effect, and the Historians' Fallacy are problems that were initially applied to different situations, and their relevance extends past their origins. Confirmation Bias has to be considered when testing hypothesis. It, by nature, can be extended to many different areas depending on the hypothesis being tested (Griggs 222). The Nirvana Fallacy was used to explain economic trends (Demsetz 1). The Bystander Effect was purported as an explanation as to why a woman was attacked and then murdered for a half-hour period without any of the many people who heard the attack doing anything to help (Griggs 341). The Historians' Fallacy was used to explain why people do not learn from the past (Fischer xvii). Each of these flaws in the human mind carries over to different aspects of the human existence, in this case they were adapted to explain why this country is currently experiencing hard times.<br />
  <br />
  Apathy and ignorance are two concepts that strongly affect our country. Concepts like Confirmation Bias, the Nirvana Fallacy, the Bystander Effect, and the Historians' Fallacy prevent progress from being made because they prevent people from actually attempting to change things. But they are not unstoppable entities; it is possible to move past them. Therefore, while apathy may prevent the ignorant from voting, neither is acceptable. Our citizens are actually in a position to make great changes in this country, but they cannot do so if they are not motivated and properly informed. Our citizens must make a conscious effort to change things; they cannot let people decide for them. This country cannot make progress until people overcome their apathy and start caring.<br />
