    <h1>Jerry the Curiousity</h1>

    <p>Jerry woke up in a fog. He looked at his noise-making clock and hit the button to turn off the alarm before getting out of bed. It was 4:58. He had an hour to get ready before he has to meet with his running partner outside his building. He went through the motions of a morning routine: shower, shave, eat. Soon he was dressed and at the front door. Doing the check for his wallet and watch he departs. He got on the elevator, his last respite before his run, but he felt uncomfortable the entire ride. <br />
<br />
When he got on there was a couple with a little girl, and once he got on they wouldn't stop staring at him, looking enthusiastic. They stood in an awkward silence, Jerry doing his best to ignore the three before their daughter broke the silence. <br />
<br />
She said: <q>Your dad was born in Birmingham, Alabama.</q><br />
<br />
Jerry chose to ignore this too and hit the button for the next floor that was going to come up, resolved to take the stairs. It wasn't until he was a few flights down before he realized something. That girl was right about his dad.<br />
<br />
Pushing it to the back of his mind. He walked out he doors to the cold November air, glad to see a familiar face waiting for him. June, his running mate, greeted him. But as they ran down the block he got a strange feeling. He looked behind him to see June with the same expression as the people in the elevator. Not looking where he was stumbled and rolled on the ground. June stopped next to him, looking down. <br />
<br />
<q>When you were 8 you stole a candy bar from the supermarket and hid it under your bed for a year out of guilt.</q> Said June with an unblinking gaze.<br />
<br />
<q>How the hell would you know that?</q> Asked Jerry, a bit disbelieving. <br />
<br />
<q>You don't know? You're a curiosity.</q> Replied June. <br />
<br />
Jerry had scraped up his knee and hands, so he limped home. June kept on with her run, but watched Jerry until he was out of sight. The man got into the elevator again and found himself standing next to his land lady. She was just as the others, same unblinking stare. <br />
<br />
<q>You lost your virginity at age 24 because you have trouble talking to women when intimacy is involved.</q> Said the old lady. <br />
<br />
<q>What makes you say something as silly as that?</q> Laughed Jerry, trying to hide the shame he felt over that secret he'd kept from almost everybody. <br />
<br />
<q>You're a curiosity.</q> Replied the old woman, not breaking her gaze.  <br />
<br />
Jerry had resolved himself to just go home and not leave for the rest of the day, but he had errands to run and things that couldn't wait. There was also only one person who could have known everything that these people had said.  Once the elevator hit his floor he jogged to his door, ignoring his stinging knee and quickly went inside. After cleaning his cuts he found his cell and dialed his brother. However, when the phone picked up his brother was the one to speak first. <br />
<br />
<q>When dad died he wanted you to give a eulogy as a last wish, but you chose not to go to his funeral instead.</q> Said his brother, his tone the same as the girls, his land lady's, and June's when they gave a fact. <br />
<br />
Jerry didn't speak, he hung up immediately. No one but he and his mother knew that. He hadn't told anyone else. Jerry sat down and put his bandaged hands over his face. What was the rule here? Who could have told his brother that? Jerry looked at this table and saw a pile of letters. He had to make it to the mailbox down the street. <br />
<br />
<q>Just focus on that for now.</q> He thought to himself.<br />
</br />
He took the stairs to avoid meeting people and walked out the back of the building, a longer route but less likely to encounter people. He saw the mailbox and walked to the end of the street, waiting for the light. To his dismay a woman walked next to him at the curb. Not waiting for her to tell him some other secret of his out loud he snapped at her. <br />
<br />
<q>What, you going to tell me what underwear I'm wearing today?</q> Grimaced Jerry. <br />
<br />
The woman looked him, shocked. She didn't have that burning gaze the others had. The first thing out of her mouth wasn't a secret of his either. She slapped him across the face and shouted: <q>Creep!</q> before storming off. Jerry stood there dumbfounded. He couldn't believe he finally met someone not like the others and she thinks he's a <q>creep.</q> Jerry dropped the letters and chased after the woman. She was the only one who didn't think he was a <q>curiosity.</q>
