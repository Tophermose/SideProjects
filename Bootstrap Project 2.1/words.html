    <main>
    <p>When the are no words to describe what we are<br />
    For you the world, the universe, any star<br />
    No need to define, refine, redesign, or look for a sign<br />
    <br />
    Such affection in every direction<br />
    A declaration that needs no explanation<br />
    Simple and pure, it can certainly endure<br />
    <br />
    The test of time, of reality, and causality<br />
    I never question my detection<br />
    Of the feelings I feel,<br />
    I know that they're real<br />
    <br />
    My shepherd, my Virgil, my guide<br />
    Through feelings I feel inside<br />
    That I didn't think were true<br />
    Until I met you</p>
