    <p>It wouldn't be surprising<br />
    if the sky fell tomorrow<br />
    if stoic people wept alone to hide their sorrow<br />
    if some looked and still lept<br />
    if promises couldn't be kept<br />
    And it wouldn't even matter<br />
    if the ground completely shatters<br />
    because if we are together<br />
    hands holding tight<br />
    the world could end<br />
    but our future would still look bright</p>
