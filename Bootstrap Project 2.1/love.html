    <h1>What I Mean Is I Love You</h1>

  <body>
    <main>
    <p> I often forget to see<br />
    What being with you can be<br />
    <br />
    I have to concede, I must reread,<br />
    planted in my mind like a seed,<br />
    a characteristic of my breed<br />
    <br />
    Then you're there and everything's better<br />
    I become a real go-getter<br />
    I crawl out of the shell of my<br />
    own personal hell and like a school's<br />
    final bell you make things swell<br />
    <br />
    I don't know how you do it<br />
    but you get me through it<br />
    the rough patches burn up like matches,<br />
    unlock like latches, the sadness detaches<br />
    <br />
    You bring me out of the gloom<br />
    For depression you spell doom<br />
    <br />
    What I mean is I love you<br />
