            <h1><span class="noun">Asexuality</span> is real-and it has nothing to do with <span class="noun">celibacy</span></h1>
            <p>When it comes to <span class="noun">queer</span> <span class="noun">sexualities</span>, most <span class="noun">Americans</span> are familiar with <span class="noun">homosexuality</span> and <span class="noun">bisexuality</span>. 
                But there’s more to the <span class="noun">LGBTQ</span> <span class="noun">umbrella</span> than just <span class="verb">experiencing</span> sexual <span class="noun">attraction</span> to the same <span class="noun">gender</span>. 
                <span class="noun">Asexuality</span> is <span class="adverb">gradually</span> <span class="verb">growing</span> in <span class="noun">visibility</span>, and that means that the <span class="noun">definition</span> of <span class="noun">asexual</span> has developed its own broad <span class="noun">spectrum</span>. 
                More and more, <span class="noun">activists</span> are <span class="verb">shedding</span> <span class="noun">light</span> onto the <span class="noun">hardships</span> that <span class="noun">asexual</span> <span class="noun">people</span> go through.</p>
            <p>But most <span class="noun">Americans</span> still know very little about <span class="noun">asexuality</span> and how <span class="noun">asexuals</span> <span class="verb">experience</span> the <span class="noun">world</span> around them. 
                What’s it like <span class="verb">being</span> <span class="noun">asexual</span>? Here’s <span class="noun">everything</span> <span class="noun">you</span> need to know.</p>

            <h2>What Does <span class="noun">Asexual</span> Mean?</h2>
            <p><span class="noun">Asexuality</span> is a “sexual <span class="noun">orientation</span> <span class="verb">characterized</span> by a persistent lack of sexual <span class="noun">attraction</span> toward any <span class="noun">gender</span>,” according to the <span class="noun">website</span> <span class="noun">What is Asexuality</span>? 
                <span class="noun">Asexual</span> <span class="noun">people</span> neither “<span class="verb">experience</span> sexual <span class="noun">attraction</span>” nor can they <span class="verb">choose</span> to; they are simply <span class="verb">born</span> without sexual <span class="noun">desires</span>. 
                <span class="adverb">Conversely</span>, <span class="noun">people</span> who do <span class="verb">experience</span> <span class="noun">sexuality</span> are referred to as either sexual or allosexual <span class="noun">people</span>, <span class="noun">AVENWiki</span> <span class="verb">reports</span>.</p>
            <p>It’s important to <span class="verb">point</span> out that <span class="noun">asexuality</span> isn’t a <span class="noun">lifestyle</span> <span class="noun">decision</span>. 
                Rather, <span class="noun">asexuals</span> simply do not <span class="verb">feel</span> sexual <span class="noun">attraction</span>. 
                <span class="noun">People</span> who are <span class="noun">celibate</span>, <span class="verb">dealing</span> with sexual <span class="noun">repression</span>, or <span class="adverb">actively</span> <span class="verb">choose</span> not to <span class="verb">embrace</span> their sexual <span class="noun">desires</span> aren’t <span class="adverb">necessarily</span> <span class="noun">asexual</span>. 
                Rather, <span class="noun">asexuals</span> simply do not <span class="verb">have</span> the <span class="verb">desire</span>, <span class="verb">need</span>, or <span class="verb">feeling</span> to <span class="verb">have</span> <span class="noun">sex</span> with <span class="noun">others</span>.</p>

            <h2>What about romantic <span class="noun">relationships</span> or asexual <span class="verb">dating</span>?</h2>
            <p><span class="noun">Asexual</span> <span class="noun">people</span> may not <span class="verb">experience</span> sexual <span class="noun">attraction</span>, but that doesn’t necessarily mean <span class="noun">asexuals</span> can’t <span class="verb">have</span> <span class="noun">sex</span> or <span class="verb">date</span> other <span class="noun">people</span>. 
                <span class="noun">Asexuals</span> can still <span class="verb">feel</span> <span class="adverb">romantically</span> <span class="verb">attached</span> to <span class="noun">others</span>. 
                Rather, the sexual <span class="noun">component</span> behind romantic <span class="noun">attraction</span> simply isn’t a <span class="noun">part</span> of their <span class="noun">identity</span>.</p>
            <p>Instead, <span class="noun">asexuals</span> <span class="verb">find</span> <span class="noun">themselves</span> on the asexual <span class="noun">spectrum</span>, which <span class="verb">breaks</span> down romantic and sexual <span class="noun">attraction</span> by <span class="verb">showing</span> the various sexual <span class="noun">identities</span> <span class="noun">people</span> can <span class="verb">have</span>.</p>
            <p>From <span class="noun">there</span>, the <span class="noun">spectrum</span> <span class="verb">branches</span> off into various romantic <span class="noun">experiences</span> that can <span class="verb">exist</span> in <span class="noun">conjunction</span> with many different <span class="noun">categories</span>. Here is each <span class="verb">listed</span> with <span class="noun">definitions</span>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong><span class="noun">Heteroromantic</span></strong>–Romantic <span class="noun">attraction</span>, to one specific <span class="noun">gender</span>, different from one’s <span class="noun">own</span> (e.g., <span class="noun">men</span> who <span class="verb">love</span> <span class="noun">women</span>)</li>
                <li><strong><span class="noun">Homoromantic</span></strong>–Romantic <span class="noun">attraction</span> to one’s own <span class="noun">gender</span> (e.g., <span class="noun">women</span> who <span class="verb">love</span> <span class="noun">women</span>)</li>
                <li><strong><span class="noun">Biromantic</span></strong>–Romantic <span class="noun">attraction</span> to one’s own <span class="noun">gender</span> as well as <span class="noun">others’</span> (e.g., <span class="noun">women</span> who <span class="verb">love</span> <span class="noun">men</span> and <span class="noun">women</span>)</li>
                <li><strong><span class="noun">Panromantic</span></strong>-Romantic <span class="noun">attraction</span> to <span class="noun">others</span>, <span class="adverb">regardless</span> of <span class="noun">gender</span> (e.g., <span class="noun">men</span> who can <span class="verb">fall</span> in <span class="noun">love</span> with any <span class="noun">gender</span>)</li>
                <li><strong><span class="noun">Aromantic</span></strong>-Not <span class="verb">experiencing</span> romantic <span class="noun">attraction</span>.
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, while there are plenty of <span class="noun">asexuals</span> that do not <span class="verb">feel</span> a need to <span class="verb">fall</span> in <span class="noun">love</span> with other <span class="noun">people</span>, there are also many <span class="noun">asexuals</span> that <span class="verb">experience</span> romantic <span class="noun">affection</span> for <span class="noun">others</span> without sexual <span class="noun">desires</span>.
                That means <span class="noun">asexual</span> <span class="verb">dating</span> <span class="adverb">actually</span> <span class="verb">looks</span> similar to other romantic <span class="noun">relationships</span>. 
                It’s just that <span class="noun">sex</span> may be <span class="verb">negotiated</span> within the <span class="noun">relationship</span> if one <span class="noun">partner</span> <span class="verb">experiences</span> sexual <span class="noun">attraction</span> and the <span class="noun">other</span> does not.</p>
            <p><span class="noun">Asexuality</span> can be difficult to <span class="verb">figure</span> out, in part because <span class="noun">sexuality</span> is such a complicated <span class="noun">human</span> <span class="noun">experience</span>. 
                But <span class="noun">asexuality</span> isn’t a <span class="noun">binary</span>, and there are plenty of <span class="noun">ways</span> to <span class="verb">define</span> your <span class="noun">sexuality</span> on the <span class="noun">asexual</span> <span class="noun">spectrum</span>.</p>

            <h2>How can you <span class="verb">tell</span> if you’re <span class="noun">asexual</span>?</h2>
            <p>The <span class="noun">site</span> <span class="noun">What is Asexuality</span>? <span class="verb">hosts</span> a <span class="noun">list</span> of <span class="noun">questions</span> that <span class="adverb">commonly</span> pertain to <span class="noun">asexual</span> <span class="noun">experiences</span>. 
                For instance, many <span class="noun">asexuals</span> don’t <span class="verb">understand</span> why <span class="noun">sex</span> is so <span class="verb">appealing</span> or why <span class="noun">others</span> <span class="verb">find</span> <span class="noun">people</span> “hot” and “sexy.” 
                Other <span class="noun">asexuals</span> don’t <span class="adverb">particularly</span> <span class="verb">comprehend</span> <span class="noun">sex</span> <span class="noun">scenes</span> in <span class="noun">movies</span> and <span class="noun">books</span>, instead <span class="verb">wondering</span> why <span class="noun">characters</span> <span class="verb">feel</span> a sudden and intense physical <span class="noun">desire</span> for one <span class="noun">another</span>. 
                <span class="noun">Asexuality Archive</span> also <span class="verb">hosts</span> a <span class="noun">series</span> <span class="verb">breaking</span> down <span class="noun">asexual</span> <span class="noun">experiences</span>, with the <span class="noun">intent</span> of <span class="verb">helping</span> <span class="noun">readers</span> <span class="verb">figure</span> out if they are <span class="noun">asexual</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="noun">Asexuality</span> can be difficult to <span class="verb">figure</span> out, and for some, it can take <span class="noun">months</span> or <span class="noun">years</span> to <span class="verb">understand</span> their sexual <span class="noun">identity</span>. 
                But above all, <span class="noun">asexuality</span> is <span class="verb">defined</span> by the <span class="noun">person</span> who is <span class="noun">asexual</span>. 
                That means every <span class="noun">asexual</span> has a different <span class="noun">relationship</span> with their <span class="noun">sexuality</span>, and no two <span class="noun">asexuals</span> <span class="verb">experience</span> the <span class="noun">world</span> the same way.</p>
